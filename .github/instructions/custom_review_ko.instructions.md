* **Review Language**: [Specify preferred language, e.g., English, Korean, etc.]
* **Comment Style**: [Formal, informal, technical, etc.]
* **Feedback Tone**: [Constructive, direct, collaborative, etc.]

## Guidelines

* Use consistent language throughout the review process
* Adapt tone based on team preferences and culture
* Ensure feedback is clear and actionable regardless of language choice
